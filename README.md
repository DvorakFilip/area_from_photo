# area_from_photo

The idea:
  You upload a photo, choose color and tolerance. The program output tells you, how many independent areas of that color (+- tolerance) are in the image.
  It also outputs the average radius and sum of sphere areas (computed with radius for each colored area). Processed image is created to visualize what this program does.
